                <p><img id="profile" src="Assets/images/abigail.jpg" alt="Abigail Jackson">Hello! My name is Abigail, and I'm a full-stack web developer! I believe in living holistically and that if everyone was allowed to live into all they were made to be, the world would be a better place.
                    That being said, I believe that innovation in technology and creativity in art are two sides of the same coin, and I love to see the intersection of both. 
                    Before learning to code, I was already growing my skills as a designer and photographer. Through these skills, I seek to tell stories that resonate with the 
                    hearts of people in a way that challenges everyone to see the world through different perspectives.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have a background in the non-profit sector and seek to build into structures that are accessible and empower people from diverse walks of life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As someone who is both Filipinx and white, I have learned to see the world through different lenses, and it has profoundly affected my work and art.
                    I am in the process of learning my people's history and hope to one day see the Asian-American narrative in a greater position of legitimacy.
